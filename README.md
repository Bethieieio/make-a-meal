# :hamburger: make-a-meal

- Hi, I'm Beth, I am a "Code Institute Student".
- Make a Meal was made for a colleague of mine to help him decide what he wanted for dinner.
- The site generates mains eg: chicken, a secondary option eg: potato wedges and a tertiary option eg: vegetables with clicks of buttons.
- It also chooses an option for a mealy meal eg: pasta bolognase.
- I use html, css, javascript and bootstrap.
